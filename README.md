# About Union Finance

Union is a member-owned credit protocol built on Ethereum where members can underwrite lines of credit to other member addresses.
Union operates as a DAO and enables any address to accumulate a credit line on-chain in a permission-less, crypto-native way. The protocol itself is not an underwriter of risk, but rather a mechanism to lower the cost of coordinating trust into available credit.

By aggregating lines of credit, Union Members can source capital at a lower cost than any single member could on their own. This enables a virtuous circle of more available credit, lower borrowing costs, and increased lending activity.
